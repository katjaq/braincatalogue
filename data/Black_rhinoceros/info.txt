Although the rhinoceros is referred to as <i>black<\/i>, its colors vary from brown to gray.<\/p><p>The other African rhinoceros is the white rhinoceros (<i>Ceratotherium simum<\/i>). The word \"white\" in the name \"white rhinoceros\" is a misinterpretation of the Afrikaans word <i>wyd<\/i>, itself derived from the Dutch word <i>wijd<\/i> for wide, referring to its square upper lip, as opposed to the pointed or hooked lip of the black rhinoceros. These species are now sometimes referred to as the square-lipped (for white) or hook-lipped (for black) rhinoceros.<\/p>",
