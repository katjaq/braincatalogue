Native to Indonesia and Malaysia, orangutans are currently found in only the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. Classified in the genus <i><b>Pongo<\/b><\/i>, orangutans were considered to be one species. However, since 1996, they have been divided into two species: the Bornean orangutan (<i>P. pygmaeus<\/i>) and the Sumatran orangutan (<i>P. abelii<\/i>). In addition, the Bornean species is divided into three subspecies. The orangutans are also the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which also included several other species, such as the three extinct species of the genus <i>Gigantopithecus<\/i>, including the largest known primate <i>Gigantopithecus blacki<\/i>. Both extant species had their genomes sequenced and they appear to have diverged around 400,000\u00a0years ago. Orangutans diverged from the rest of the great apes 15.7 to 19.3 million years ago (mya).<\/p>",
