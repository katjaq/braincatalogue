        "description": "<p>The <b>blackbuck<\/b> (<i>Antilope cervicapra<\/i>) is an ungulate species of antelope native to the Indian Subcontinent that has been classified as <i>near threatened<\/i> by IUCN since 2003, as its range has decreased sharply during the 20th century. The native population is stable, with an estimated 50,000 individuals.<\/p><p>The blackbuck is the only living species of the genus <i>Antilope<\/i>. Its generic name stems from the Latin word <i>antalopus<\/i>, a horned animal. The specific name <i>cervicapra<\/i> is composed of the Latin words <i>capra<\/i>, she-goat and <i>cervus<\/i>, deer.<\/p><p>Blackbucks generally resemble gazelle, found on the Arabian peninsula. Blackbucks are slender with a head-to-body length of about 120\u00a0cm (47\u00a0in). They are about 73.7 to 83.8\u00a0cm (29.0 to 33.0\u00a0in) high at the shoulder. Males are larger than females. Adult males range in weight from 34 to 45\u00a0kg (75 to 99\u00a0lb); females weigh 31 to 39\u00a0kg (68 to 86\u00a0lb). The tail is short and compressed. Both sexes are white on the belly, around the eyes and on the inside of the legs. They differ in the coloration of the head and back. Female and young blackbucks are yellowish-fawn coloured on the back and on the outside of the limbs; the lower parts are white. The two colours are sharply divided by a distinct pale lateral band. Old male bucks are blackish brown on the back, on the sides and front of the neck. They become almost black with age, only the nape remains brownish rufous, and the pale lateral band disappears. Only males have horns that are diverging, cylindrical, spiral, and ringed throughout. The rings are closer together near the skull. The turns of the spiral vary from less than 3 to 5. Horns are 45.6\u00e2\u0080\u009368.5\u00a0cm (18.0\u00e2\u0080\u009327.0\u00a0in) long.<\/p>",
