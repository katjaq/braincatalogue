        "description": "<p>The rhesus macaque is brown or grey in color and has a pink face, which is bereft of fur. Its tail is of medium length and averages between 20.7 and 22.9\u00a0cm (8.1 and 9.0\u00a0in). Adult males measure approximately 53\u00a0cm (21\u00a0in) on average and weigh about 7.7\u00a0kg (17\u00a0lb). Females are smaller, averaging 47\u00a0cm (19\u00a0in) in length and 5.3\u00a0kg (12\u00a0lb) in weight. Rhesus macaques have on average 50 vertebrae. Their intermembral index (ratio of arm length to leg length) is 89%. They have dorsal scapulae and a wide rib cage.<\/p><p>The rhesus macaque has 32 teeth with a dental formula of 2.1.2.3\/2.1.2.3 and bilophodont molars. The upper molars have four cusps: paracone, metacone, protocone and hypocone. The lower molars also have four cusps: metaconid, protoconid, hypoconid and entoconid.<\/p>",
