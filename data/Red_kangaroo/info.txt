        "description": "<p>This species is a very large kangaroo with long, pointed ears and a squared-off muzzle. Males have short, red-brown fur, fading to pale buff below and on the limbs. Females are smaller than males and are blue-grey with a brown tinge, pale grey below, although arid zone females are coloured more like males. It has two forelimbs with small claws, two muscular hind-limbs, which are used for jumping, and a strong tail which is often used to create a tripod when standing upright.<\/p><p>The red kangaroo's legs work much like a rubber band. The males can leap over 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) in one leap.<\/p><p>Males grow up to a head-and-body length of 1.3\u00e2\u0080\u00931.6\u00a0m (4.3\u00e2\u0080\u00935.2\u00a0ft) with a tail that adds a further 1\u00e2\u0080\u00931.2\u00a0m (3.3\u00e2\u0080\u00933.9\u00a0ft) to the total length. Females are considerably smaller, with a head-and-body length of 85\u00e2\u0080\u0093105\u00a0cm (33\u00e2\u0080\u009341\u00a0in) and tail length of 65\u00e2\u0080\u009385\u00a0cm (26\u00e2\u0080\u009333\u00a0in). Females can weigh from 18 to 40\u00a0kg (40 to 88\u00a0lb), while males typically weigh around twice as much at 55 to 85\u00a0kg (121 to 187\u00a0lb). The average red kangaroo stands approximately 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft) tall to the top of the head in upright posture. Large mature males can stand more than 1.8\u00a0m (5.9\u00a0ft) tall, with the largest confirmed one having been around 2.1\u00a0m (6.9\u00a0ft) tall and weighed 91\u00a0kg (201\u00a0lb). Accounts of sizes greater than this are not uncommon, with some reportedly reaching a weight of approximately 150\u00a0kg (330\u00a0lb).<\/p>",
