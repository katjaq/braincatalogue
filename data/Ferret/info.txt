        "description": "<p>The <b>ferret<\/b> (<i>Mustela putorius furo<\/i>) is the domesticated form of the European Polecat, a mammal belonging to the weasel genus of the family Mustelidae. They typically have brown, black, white, or mixed fur. They have an average length of 20\u00a0inches (51\u00a0cm) including a 5\u00a0inch (13\u00a0cm) tail, weigh about , and have a natural lifespan of 7 to 10\u00a0years. Ferrets are sexually dimorphic predators with males being substantially larger than females.<\/p><p>Several other Mustelids also have the word <i>ferret<\/i> in their common names, including an endangered species, the Black-footed Ferret.<\/p><p>The history of the ferret's domestication is uncertain, like that of most other domestic animals, but it is likely that ferrets have been domesticated for at least 2,500\u00a0years. They are still used for hunting rabbits in some parts of the world today, but increasingly they are kept simply as pets.<\/p>",
